- no way for imported cluster to automatically oin a ManagedClusterSet to help with Placements
- The ManagedClusterSet talks about selector: LabelSelector but doesn;t actually support it despite the global ManagedClusterSet using it
- ACM registration Token is embedded in the ISO, not cool. Think we can do this better with FDO, look into it further
